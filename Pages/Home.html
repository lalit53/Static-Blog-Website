  <h3 style="text-align: center; color: white;">My Motto</h3>
  <p style="color: white;">I currently reside in Oak Hill,Virginia. I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology and am currently looking for a full time job in the field of computer programming and technology.

    I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on learning new technologies and reading on the advancements happening in this field . Also, I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and develop crucial interpersonal skills. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.
    
    A bit about my history; I grew up in Mumbai,India where I completed my Bachelor in Computer Engineering. On the completion of my Bachelors, I decided to further pursue my education by enrolling in the Computer Science Graduate program in SIT. I would consider this to be one of the biggest decisions of my life.
    
    Apart from my passion in technology, I also believe in health and well being. I enjoy long distance running, cycling, swimming. I have run the Mumbai Half Marathon five times and to take it up a notch, I am currently training for a triathlon to understand and take my abilities to the next level. I also love soccer(die hard fan of Manchester United, GGMU!) and I have captained the soccer team of my Engineering school which is where I learnt the importance of team building, coaching, focus and determination.
    
    Why work with me?
    My undergraduate background and the coursework I have completed during my Master’s has made me dexterous and efficient in dealing with contemporary technology.
    
    I’m focused on strategies that are sustainable in the long term and a team player who is obsessed not only with personal growth but the development of my team and peers.
    
    I am confident that with my good communication skills and strong sense of responsibility, I would prove to be an asset to your company.
    
    My resume goes over the standard items, but please understand that I don't embellish my capabilities. I don't think that is helpful in this case.
