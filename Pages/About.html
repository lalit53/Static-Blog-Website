          <h1 class="mt-0" style="color: white;">About Me</h5>
          <p>I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on learning new technologies and reading on the advancements happening in this field . Also, I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and develop crucial interpersonal skills. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.</p>
         <p>A bit about my history; I grew up in Mumbai,India where I completed my Bachelor in Computer Engineering. On the completion of my Bachelors, I decided to further pursue my education by enrolling in the Computer Science Graduate program in SIT. I would consider this to be one of the biggest decisions of my life.</p>
         <p >Apart from my passion in technology, I also believe in health and well being. I enjoy long distance running, cycling, swimming. I have run the Mumbai Half Marathon five times and to take it up a notch, I am currently training for a triathlon to understand and take my abilities to the next level. I also love soccer(die hard fan of Manchester United, GGMU!) and I have captained the soccer team of my Engineering school which is where I learnt the importance of team building, coaching, focus and determination.</p>
         <p >My undergraduate background and the coursework I have completed during my Master’s has made me dexterous and efficient in dealing with contemporary technology.  </p>
         <p style="text-align: left;">I’m focused on strategies that are sustainable in the long term and a team player who is obsessed not only with personal growth but the development of my team and peers.</p>
         <p >I am confident that with my good communication skills and strong sense of responsibility, I would prove to be an asset to your company. </p>
         <p>My <Link to="/resume">resume</Link> goes over the standard items, but please understand that I don't embellish my capabilities. I don't think that is helpful in this case.</p>
